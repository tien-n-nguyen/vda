\noindent {\bf Example.} Figure~\ref{gnn-example} shows an example of
the vulnerability-introduc\-ing change for CVE-2021-37650. The change
introduced the variable \code{finalized\_dataset} at line 2,
representing a dataset that was populated at line 3 and used at lines
6 and 9. However, the input was not validated, and the code at line 9
assumed only string inputs and interpreted numbers as valid strings.
When computing the CRC of the record, this resulted in~heap buffer
overflow. {\tool} correctly~predicted this vulnerability and its
assessment {\em Severity=Medium}. GNNExplainer pointed out that
{\tool} used the changed statements and their dependencies at lines 2,
3, 6, 9 and another line (not shown), to perform classification. This
is correct since despite that line 9 is the fixed line (in a later
version), lines 2, 3, 6 are parts of the control/data flows leading to
line 9. In brief, {\tool} used the vulnerability-relevant statements
and dependencies in correct~prediction.

%Thus, program dependencies encoded in our embeddings are the
%key features enabling {\tool} in correct classification.


%Tien
%Thus, {\tool} correctly used the statements/dependencies as the key
%features in its assessment. That is, our graph representations with
%program dependencies encoded by the embeddings have positive
%contributions to {\tool}'s accuracy.


%Code assumes only strings inputs and then interprets numbers as valid
%`tstring`s. Then, when trying to compute the CRC of the record this
%results in heap buffer overflow.
