\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes {\tool}, a Context-aware, Graph-based,
Commit-level Vulnerability Assessment (VA) Model that evaluates a
vulnerabi\-lity-introducing commit and provides the CVSS assessment
grades for the vulnerability. The key advances in {\tool} over the
state-of-the-art commit-level VA approach include 1) developing a
graph-based VA model to integrate program dependencies, 2) developing
context-aware, graph-based embedding model that integrates program
dependencies and contexts, and 3) explicit representation of contexts
in vulnerability assessment. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\tool} improves the state-of-the-art model in both C and Java
vulnerability datasets. Our contextualized embeddings have other
potential applications relevant to code changes.

%We propose a new context-aware, graph-based, commit-level vulnerability assessment approach, namely {\tool} to improve the most state-of-the-art commit-level vulnerability assessment approach, DeepCVA. The key ideas that enable our approach are (1) Integrating program dependencies into our commit-level vulnerability assessment approach; (2) Learning contexualized embeddings for code changes that integrating program dependencies among the program elements and the contexts of code changes. In our {\tool}, we leverage and train the Label, Graph Convolution Network (Label-GCN) to learn the program dependencies among the changed code and its surrounding unchanged code to generate the contextualized embeddings for code changes in the automated assessment of the vulnerability assessment types.

%We have conducted extensive empirical studies to evaluate {\tool} on two different datasets in C and Java. {\tool} is able to outperform the most recent and state-of-the-art automated vulnerability assessment approach, DeepCVA. Particularly, on the C dataset, {\tool} can improve DeepCVA by xx\% and xx\% in terms of F1-score and MCC, respectively. On the Java dataset, {\tool} can improve DeepCVA by xx\% and xx\% in terms of F1-score and MCC, respectively. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that all designed components of {\tool} can positively contribute to the model.
