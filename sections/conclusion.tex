\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes {\tool}, a Context-aware, Graph-based,
Commit-level Vulnerability Detection and Assessment Model that
evaluates a commit, detects any vulnerability and provides the CVSS
assessment grades.
%for the detected vulnerability.
The key advances in {\tool} over the existing approaches include 1)
multi-task learning between vulnerability detection and assessments of
different aspects, 2) code change embedding model that integrates
program dependencies and contexts, and 3) graph-based representations
of dependencies and contexts. Our evaluation shows that on a
C dataset, {\tool} achieves 25.5\% and 26.9\%
relatively higher than the baselines in vulnerability assessment in
F-score~and MCC. In a Java dataset, {\tool} achieves
31\% and 33.3\% relatively higher in F-score and MCC. {\tool} also
relatively improves the vulnerability detection over the baselines
from 13.4â€“322\% in F-score.

%We propose a new context-aware, graph-based, commit-level vulnerability assessment approach, namely {\tool} to improve the most state-of-the-art commit-level vulnerability assessment approach, DeepCVA. The key ideas that enable our approach are (1) Integrating program dependencies into our commit-level vulnerability assessment approach; (2) Learning contexualized embeddings for code changes that integrating program dependencies among the program elements and the contexts of code changes. In our {\tool}, we leverage and train the Label, Graph Convolution Network (Label-GCN) to learn the program dependencies among the changed code and its surrounding unchanged code to generate the contextualized embeddings for code changes in the automated assessment of the vulnerability assessment types.

%We have conducted extensive empirical studies to evaluate {\tool} on two different datasets in C and Java. {\tool} is able to outperform the most recent and state-of-the-art automated vulnerability assessment approach, DeepCVA. Particularly, on the C dataset, {\tool} can improve DeepCVA by xx\% and xx\% in terms of F1-score and MCC, respectively. On the Java dataset, {\tool} can improve DeepCVA by xx\% and xx\% in terms of F1-score and MCC, respectively. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that all designed components of {\tool} can positively contribute to the model.
