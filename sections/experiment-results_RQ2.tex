We aim to demonstrate that our approach also works for vulnerability
dataset in Java. Table~\ref{rq2_results} shows that {\tool} relatively
improves DeepCVA~\cite{deepCVA-ase21} by {\em 20.4\% in macro F1-score
and 28.0\% in multi-class MCC} on the overall multi-class
classification in Java dataset. For specific VATs, {\tool} improves
DeepCVA by {\em 3.0--25.6\% in macro-F1-score and 30.8\% in
multi-class MCC}. Moreover, the largest relative improvement in macro
F1-score happens for {\em Availability} and the largest relative
improvement in multi-class MCC happens for {\em Access Vector}. The
lowest relative improvement in both macro F1-score and multi-class MCC
happens for {\em Authentication}, however, the absolute macro F1-score
value (0.68) for {\em Authentication} is highest among all the VATs.

%Table~\ref{rq2_results} shows that {\tool} outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, DeepCVA, in the automation of commit-level vulnerability assessment on the Java dataset. Particularly, {\tool} improves the state-of-the-art baseline by 14.3\% in terms of macro-F1-score, and 8.0\% in terms of multi-class MCC on the overall performance. The higher values of macro-F1-score and MCC indicate that {\tool} can perform more accurate multi-classification on Java commits than DeepCVA. As for specific types of vulnerability assessment, {\tool} improves the state-of-the-art baseline by 3.0-25.6\% in terms of macro-F1-score and 0-30.8\% in terms of macro-F1-score. The lowest relative improvement of both macro-F1-score happens when testing the $Authentication$. And when testing $Availability$, \tool and DeepCVA get the same multi-class MCC. As for the biggest relative improvement, when testing $Availability$, \tool achieves the biggest relative improvement on the macro-F1-score, and the biggest relative improvement of multi-class MCC happens when testing $Access Vector$.
