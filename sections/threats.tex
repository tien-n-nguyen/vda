\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}
The threats come from the following aspects: (1) \emph{Programming languages (PLs).}  Our approach has been tested on
Java and C commits. However, the techniques used in {\tool} are not
tied to Java or C.  In principle, our approach can applied to other PLs. (2) \emph{Generalization of the results.}  Our comparisons with
DeepCVA were only carried out on the C and Java datasets that are both publicly available.  Further validation of the comparisons with DeepCVA on other datasets should be done in future. 
%(3) \textbf{Training and Tuning.} It is impossible to test the entire hyperparameter space. However, on the Java dataset (used by DeepCVA), we reused the parameters reported in DeepCVA for training and tuning. On the C dataset,
